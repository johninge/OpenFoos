OpenFoos is a system to register foosball games and keep track of game history and statistics.
We are aiming to drive the development through Specification by Example (http://gojko.net/), but contributions for 
unspecied behaviour are also welcome. The prosess is mean to be a help in development.

Please feel free to join in or give feedback on our specifications. We want to learn! :)
